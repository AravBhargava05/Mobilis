            <p class="hero-text">
                At Mobilis, we are driven by a singular mission: to make high-quality, functional prosthetics accessible to the millions of amputees in developing countries who have historically been left behind. With over 40 million amputees worldwide, only a small fraction have access to the prosthetics and healthcare they need. This lack of access is not just a challengeâ€”it is a crisis that demands innovation and urgent action.

        <h2 class="section-title">A Prosthetic Designed for Independence</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Unlike traditional prosthetics, which require skilled professionals to fit and adjust, the Mobilis Arm is designed for self-fitting. This unique feature allows amputees to use the arm independently, without relying on specialized healthcare services. In areas where medical resources are limited, this design ensures that amputees can receive and use the prosthetic without waiting for appointments or traveling long distances.

                Each device contains several BOA dial adjusted clasps to ensure that the device is comfortable for each unique limb. The hand (or hook) is controlled through body-powered control which allows it to be used with precision while being durable. Use the size calculator below to find your perfect fit.
